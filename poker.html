                <h3>The Psychology of the Disguise</h3>
                <p>Wearing sunglasses and a hat to play poker is not merely eccentric—it is theatrical. It demonstrates:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Commitment to performance:</strong> Maintaining a physical disguise for the duration of a poker game requires dedication</li>
                    <li><strong>Tolerance for discomfort:</strong> Sunglasses indoors, particularly during a focused activity, is physically uncomfortable</li>
                    <li><strong>Strategic deception:</strong> The disguise serves a tactical purpose (hiding tells), much like a fabricated heritage might serve a social purpose</li>
